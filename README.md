# Genomic-Data-Anlaysis
In this notebook, I implemented various functions that can be useful for
sequencing a genomic string as well as assesing the quality of genome
sequenced. 

lambda_virus.fa - The Entire Genome of a lambda virus. 
phix.fa - The Entire Genome of Phi X bacteriaphage
SRR835775_1.first1000.fastq - Sequence information of a random genome. 
ERR037900_1.first1000.fastq - File with different lambda virus genome sequences with Ids and quality of the sequence. 
ERR266411_1.first1000.fastq - Sequence information of a random genome.
