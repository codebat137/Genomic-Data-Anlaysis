# Genomic-Data-Anlaysis
In this notebook, I implemented various functions that can be useful for
sequencing a genomic string as well as assesing the quality of genome
sequenced. 

The data files have been downloaded in the notebook and included in this repository as well.

1. lambda_virus.fa - The Entire Genome of a lambda virus. 
2. phix.fa - The Entire Genome of Phi X bacteriaphage
3. SRR835775_1.first1000.fastq - Sequence information of a random genome. 
4. ERR037900_1.first1000.fastq - File with different lambda virus genome sequences with Ids and quality of the sequence. 
5. ERR266411_1.first1000.fastq - Sequence information of a random genome.
